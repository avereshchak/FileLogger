# File Logger Provider for Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

A naive implementation of file logger provider for https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging/ framework. The implementation from Microsoft doesn't include a file target; they say there is a lot of third-party loggers such as NLog, Serilog etc which have already invested a lot into writing their own log targets. 

For production use they recommend using those third-party solutions.
